Single-ended queues: only one access port
Double-ended queue: both ports can be entered and exited

Create: queue = deque()
Add: queue. append() o(1)
Get: temp1 = queue[0] o(1)
Delete: temp1 = queue. popleft o(1)
Determine if the queue is empty: len(queue) == 0
Iterate through the queue: while len(queue) ! = 0:
                               temp = queue. popleft
                               print(temp)
