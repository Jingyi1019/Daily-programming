Today I did question 27. remove element. This is a question about arrays, my solution is python's fast and slow pointers.
When I did this question, I didn't set len(nums). I also had the indentation problem and needed to pay attention to the fast pointer indent.

class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        fast = 0
        slow = 0
        size = len(nums)
        while fast < size:
            if nums[fast] != val:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
        return slow
