Today I downloaded the image from jsdelivr and changed the colour and size. Also adjusted the distance between the text and the image.
Where the size of the image is displayed in width and height. If you want to adjust the position of the picture and the text, you have to write margin-left:10px and margin-right:10px on both sides respectively
80% complete, keep up the good work!


<div class="skills__names">
<img src="assets/img/python-logo-24 (1).png" style="width: 32px;height:32px; margin-right:10px">
<span class="skills__name" style="margin-left: 10px">Python</span>

</div>
